This is the source code of my website aidifico.com.

It is based on the theme template from [startbootstrap-freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer)
This theme features several content sections, a responsive portfolio grid, window modals for each portfolio item, and a working PHP contact form.
